data processing:
handle the variables :
Name Ticket Cabin Embarked
encode the missing value as NA as one category

Random forests are generally the ¡°best¡± out there, but I tried gradient boosting and support vector machines as well.

and then try to ensembling them together!!
so the final algorithm that i will use is a ensembling with rf, svm and boosting!!

age is an important variale, instead of using median, try to impute it with other variables
